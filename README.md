Hello!
My name is Stephan Teodosescu. I primarily work in R and regularly post the code for my projects here on Github. I'm a sports analytics hobbyist, and like to work with hockey and soccer data, but occasionally dabble in other sports as well as non-sports topics.

üèà  I recently built a new [website dedicated to NFL analytics](https://stephanteodosescu.com/NFL/index.html) that leverages play-by-play data from Ben Baldwin and Sebastian Carl‚Äôs fantastic nflfastR package to tell the story of the 2021 season through the lens of advanced stats.

‚öΩ  I also maintain a Premier League predictions model, the code for which can be found in the club soccer forecasts repository, and the results in this [Shiny App](https://steodosescu.shinyapps.io/club-soccer-forecasts/).

üèí  For the 2020-21 pandemic-shortened NHL season I built a [Shiny web app](https://steodosescu.shinyapps.io/nhl-odds/) visualizing up-to-date power rankings and playoff odds. 

I can be reached on Twitter [@steodosescu](https://twitter.com/steodosescu), and at my website [stephanteodosescu.com](https://stephanteodosescu.com/). You can also follow my amateur writing at the blog [Between the Pipes](https://betweenpipes.wordpress.com/).
