Hello!
My name is Stephan Teodosescu. I primarily work in R and regularly post the code for my projects here on Github. I'm a sports analytics hobbyist, and mainly like to work with hockey and soccer data, but occasionally dabble in other sports as well as non-sports topics.

üèí  I recently built a [Shiny web app](https://steodosescu.shinyapps.io/nhl-odds/) visualizing the 2020-21 NHL season.

I also maintain a Premier League forecasting model, the code of which can be found in the club soccer forecasts repository, and the results on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/stephan.teodosescu/viz/PremierLeague19-20Simulations/SimulationsDashboard).

I can be found on Twitter @steodsescu, and my website is here: [steodose.github.io](https://steodose.github.io/steodosescu.github.io/). You can also follow my amateur writing at my blog [Between the Pipes](https://betweenpipes.wordpress.com/).
